  Iterators over unset bits for EWAHBoolArray

0.5.7 (August 25th, 2016)
 Fixed issue with equality https://github.com/lemire/EWAHBoolArray/issues/14

0.5.6 (August 22nd, 2016)
 Optimized toArray/toVector functions

0.5.5 (May 5th, 2016)
 Adding trim function

0.5.4 (May 5th, 2016)
 Various streamlining

0.5.3 (May 4th, 2016)
 Fixed performance bug with fast_logicalor

0.5.2 (April 29th, 2016)
 Fixed logicalandnot 
 PR fix underflow bug during logical negation  by Matthew Vilim

0.5.1 (March 24th, 2016) 
 Will now pass all unit tests on a 32-bit ARM processor

0.5.0 (March 16th, 2016)
 Switch to C++11
 Implemented fast_logicalor for the aggregation of many bitmaps
 logicalandnot for EWAHBoolArray (suboptimal implementation)

0.4.11 (March 5th, 2016)
 Fixed a performance issue with iterators when using the comparison operator (Zarian Waheed)

0.4.10 (October 19th, 2015)
 Improving portability

0.4.9 (October 19th, 2015)
  Fixed regression with "intersects" 

0.4.8 (October 14th, 2015)
  Better unit testing

0.4.7 (October 12th, 2015)
  Performance tuning for logicalands.

0.4.6 (October 9th, 2015)
  Performance optimization (mostly for logicalands): we do not extend bitmaps perior to aggregating them. This is a slight change of semantics.

0.4.5 (August 21st, 2015) 
  Implemented "intersects".

0.4.4 (November 11th, 2014)
  Fixed build error for MSVC

0.4.3 (March 25th, 2014)
  Added numberOfOnes to BoolArray
  Fixed behavior of andNot and Not in BoolArray, with unit tests
  Fixed behavior of Not in EWAHBoolArray with unit tests
 
0.4.2 (February 20th, 2014)
  Renamed "add" to "addWord".
  Added "andNot" to BoolArray
  Optimized the behavior of the operators in BoolArray
0.4.1 (February 13th, 2014)
  Now compiles under the Intel compiler 

0.4.0 (October 4th, 2013)
  Added support for logicalxor.
  Extended considerably the uncompressed bitmap class.
  Made input/output more robust vs. empty bitmaps.
  Added several convenience methods (string conversion, bitmapOf...).
  Updated example.cpp with nicer code.


0.3.9 (September 10th, 2013)
  Added a few "inline" attributes.

0.3.8 (September 4th, 2013)
  The set method now returns a bool indicating whether the
  bit was set. This allows you to try and set the bits in 
  a non-strictly-increasing order (though only bits where 
  the return value is true will be set). If your code sets 
  the bits in strictly increasing order, the return value of
  the set method should always be true.

0.3.7 (March 29th, 2013)
  Fixed issues with Visual Studio (the portability of the code
  was improved).

0.3.6 (January 22nd, 2012)
  Resolved issue 'logical operations do not always set trailing run length correctly'
  submitted by  creitzel@rcn.com with patch from  creitzel@rcn.com. (Issue #4)

0.3.5 (November 26th, 2012)
  Resolved performance issue with EWAHBoolArraySetBitForwardIterator (issue reported by Paul Bowman)
